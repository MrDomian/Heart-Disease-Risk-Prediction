# Heart disease risk prediction (in progress)
The Heart Disease Project aims to apply data analysis and machine learning techniques to identify the risk of heart disease based on available patient features. It can be useful in the field of medicine for supporting diagnosis and clinical decision-making.

## File descriptions:
- Data preparation.ipynb: Operations to prepare the data, such as cleaning, transformation and normalisation to make it suitable for analysis and modelling.
- Data analysis.ipynb: Provides analysis of a dataset with visualisations, descriptive statistics and inferences to help understand features and relationships in the data.
- Feature engineering.ipynb: Contains an implementation of methods and strategies to process data features to improve the analysis and modelling process, such as transformations, feature creation, scaling, dimensionality reduction and feature selection.
- Profile report.ipynb: the file generates a comprehensive summary and analysis of the dataset, including statistical measures, data distribution, missing values, correlations and interactive visualisations, using the pandas_profiling library.
- Machine learning.ipynb: Performs learning for heart disease risk detection using various machine learning algorithms. The machine learning provides relevant information, and performance measures are measured for each model.
- Heart disease: Folder containing raw datasets, information about them and other relevant files.
- heart_disease_risk.csv: Processed CSV file containing heart disease data, ready for analysis and modelling.
- processed.cleveland.data: CSV file containing the original unprocessed heart disease data, located in the Heart disease folder.
